**PRIVACY POLICY**

**Harmoniq Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy describes how our app handles your data, explains your rights, and outlines our commitment to your privacy.

**Data Collection and Usage**
Our app collects limited personal data required for functionality, including:
- Spotify account information: To personalize your experience and enable core app features, Harmoniq accesses your Spotify account data with your permission including Spotify user ID, followed artists, created playlists, playback state, and device info with your permission.
- Usage data: We collect basic usage data, like phone OS to understand app performance and improve user experience.
- Spotify scope permissions: Here is the list of scopes that you were required to give Harmoniq to use our app and why we require it:
* user-read-private - lets the app verify who you are and check if you have Spotify Premium. This is done with your **Spotify user ID**. 
* user-follow-read - used to show your followed artists
* user-read-playback-state - checks if something is already playing on your Spotify
* user-modify-playback-state - lets the app start Spotify automatically if not started
* playlist-read-private - used to load your personal playlists
* playlist-read-collaborative - includes shared playlists you've joined
* streaming - enables the app to play tracks from Spotify
* app-remote-control - allows the app to control playback on your devices

**Data Storage and Security**
All personal data is stored securely and encrypted locally on your device. We do not send your data to any external servers, and we never share it with third parties. The only exception is communication with Spotify's API to provide app functionality, in full accordance with Spotify's Developer Policy. Cached data (playlists and artists) are stored locally on your device and automatically cleared when you "Disconnect Spotify" from the settings. Otherwise, it is refreshed every hour or when you refresh in Harmoniq to make sure your data is consistent with Spotify.

**Data Sharing**
Your data is never sold or shared with advertisers. Interactions with third-party services such as Spotify strictly adhere to their respective privacy policies and terms of use.

**Your Rights**
You can disconnect your Spotify account at any time by opening the Settings page in the app and tapping “Disconnect Spotify”. This will immediately delete your personal data, including tokens, playlists, and cached listening data stored locally on your device. Alternatively, you may visit your Spotify Account Apps page and revoke Harmoniq's access directly. 

**Policy Updates**
We may periodically update this policy to reflect new features or regulatory requirements. Any significant changes will be communicated within the app.

**Contact Us**
For any questions or concerns about this policy or your data, please contact us at **max.harmoniq@gmail.com**.

**Thank you for using Harmoniq. Your privacy is important to us.**
